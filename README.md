LSAlertView
===========

Customizable alert view replacement for iOS, written in C#. Code is based on the Objective-C version at https://github.com/wimagguc/ios-custom-alertview

There's some room for improvements:
- use drawing methods to draw seperator lines, as the current seperator lines (created by UIViews) for buttons are a bit too "thick" due to shadows and the like.
- probably other aspects as well :)
